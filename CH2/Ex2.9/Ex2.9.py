Text input and Raw Input
'''
name = input("Name please: ")
print("Name entered was: " + name)
age = input ("Age please: ")
print("Age Entered was: "+ age)

raw_input is archaic and seems to not even work in some GUIs

rawname = raw_input("Name please [raw btw]: ")
print("Raw name is: "+ rawname)
rawage = raw_input("Age please [raw btw]: ")
print("Raw age is: "+ rawage)
